For the alpha version the script is working.
To make it run you:
1) Open the max file
2) run the script
3) run the MASSfx simulation and it will run the script automaticaly.


To change any settings on the script like maxSpeed, steps, or any one of the constants, please open the script and change, them save and reevaluate.
You do not need to stop the simulation to change settings, when you re-evaluate, the simulation will be updated automaticaly. 

To evaluate for errors, I would advice to un-comment the print settings so you can check where the script might break.
All of the print sections have ben coded so it will print every step with a code.

I will most likely not update this script to the next max, it works on max 2018.
